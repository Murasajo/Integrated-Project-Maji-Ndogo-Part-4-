#### Notebook Contents

This Jupyter Notebook, **Integrated Project Maji Ndogo (Part 4)**, is the final part of the project series. It involves the following key components:

1. **Data Aggregation and Cleaning**:
   - The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries and loading datasets.
   - Data from different tables (`location`, `water_source`, `visits`, `well_pollution`) are merged.
   - Various SQL JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) are used to combine the data tables into a single comprehensive table for analysis.
   - Duplicate records are handled by filtering out non-essential rows.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - The merged data is analyzed to identify patterns and derive meaningful insights.
   - Key questions addressed include the distribution of water sources across different provinces and towns, and the identification of specific areas with broken taps.

3. **Summary and Reporting**:
   - Results from the data analysis are summarized to provide a clear picture of the water resource situation.
   - Insights are translated into actionable knowledge to guide engineers and decision-makers in improving water access and quality.
